        Dice the mushrooms and bell peppers into small pieces and fry over medium heat in a non-stick pan with a bit of oil (optional) Sprinkle with salt. Cook until mushrooms are browned (I like to let the mushrooms sit for a bit to brown).

        Add the medium-firm tofu (crumble it with fingers) and mix with the vegetables. Let it sit for a couple minutes until the tofu browns then mix well with the vegetables.
